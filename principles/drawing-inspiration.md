# Core Philosophy

- True originality is nearly impossible with abundant prior art, designers, and LLMs
- All work is influenced by generations of artists
- Originality lies in how you weave ideas that have been previously woven differently

# The "Stealing" Quote Evolution

**Misattributed version**: "Good artists copy, great artists steal" (falsely attributed to Picasso)

**Original T.S. Eliot (1920s)**:
"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different from that from which it was torn."

**Corrected interpretation**: Great artists steal and **elevate**

# Making It Your Own

## Learning Through Recreation

- Re-creating others' work is one of the best ways to grow
- Forces you to solve the same design problems as original author
- Painstaking process builds understanding

## Attribution Best Practices

- Recognize and credit sources of inspiration when output clearly resembles input
- Tempting to pass off as your own, but attribution gets better response
- Tag or mention original creators when appropriate

## Remixing Strategy

- **Best approach**: Remix multiple sources to create something uniquely yours
- Avoid single-source copying
- Combine influences to create new synthesis

# Real Examples

## Logos Carousel

- **Source**: OpenAI website carousel
- **Iteration**: Added subtle blur effect for cleaner crossfades
- **Attribution**: Linked to source because it closely resembled original
- **Purpose**: Verify design intuition, not pass off as original

## Devouring Details Homepage

- **Source**: Coinbase branding still frame from Behance
- **Constraint**: Needed more text than original
- **Result**: Constraint forced iteration away from source
- **Context**: Wanted interaction-first experience for interaction design site

## Line Minimap

- **Source**: Rosemary Butcher portfolio website
- **Iteration**: Different motion design and structure
- **Result**: Visual similarities remain but creative distance established

# Key Principles

- Recognize you're influenced by everyone's work
- Completely original ideas are fantasy
- Good artists copy, great artists steal, **exceptional artists elevate**
- Make something your own by remixing various sources
- Attribute credit when copying for learning -> gets better response
- Use constraints to force iteration away from sources
- Creative distance comes through multiple iterations and personal interpretation

# Process Framework

1. Find inspiration from multiple sources
2. Identify specific elements that resonate
3. Apply constraints that force iteration
4. Remix and synthesize into something new
5. Attribute sources when resemblance is clear
6. Elevate through personal interpretation and refinement
